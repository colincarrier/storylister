# Storylister v16.1 - Enhanced Media ID Detection

## Release Date: September 26, 2025

## Overview

This version implements a **comprehensive media ID detection system** that finds the story ID from multiple reliable sources in the DOM. This solves the critical issue where the first story lacks a numeric ID in the URL, causing cache mismatches and viewer count inconsistencies.

## ðŸŽ¯ Key Enhancement: Robust Media ID Extraction

### The Problem
- First story URL often lacks the numeric media ID (`/stories/username/` instead of `/stories/username/123456789/`)
- This caused cache key mismatches when navigating between stories
- Resulted in "sometimes 25, sometimes 6" viewer counts
- NEW badges and viewer tracking were unreliable

### The Solution: 6-Layer Media ID Detection

The new `getMediaIdFromDOM()` function checks these sources in order:

1. **URL Path** (fastest) - `/stories/<owner>/<MEDIA_ID>/`
2. **"Seen by" Link** - The href contains `/stories/<owner>/<MEDIA_ID>/seen_by/`
3. **Alternate Links** - `<link rel="alternate">` tags with story URLs
4. **App Deep Links** - `<meta property="al:*">` tags for mobile app handoff
5. **Base64 Bootstrap Scripts** - Decoded `data:text/javascript;base64` scripts
6. **JSON Script Payloads** - Any JSON/LD+JSON scripts with story data

## Technical Improvements

### New Helper Functions

**`getStoryOwnerFromURL()`**
- Extracts the story owner from the current URL
- Used to scope media ID searches to the correct user

**`matchIdFromText(text, owner)`**  
- Intelligently extracts media IDs from text content
- Prioritizes owner-scoped matches for accuracy
- Falls back to generic ID patterns

**`canonicalKey()`**
- Builds a stable cache key using owner and media ID
- Format: `/stories/<owner>/<mediaId>/` when ID is found
- Falls back to pathname when ID unavailable

### Enhanced Story Change Detection

The `onDOMChange()` function now:
- Uses `canonicalKey()` for consistent key generation
- Properly detects media ID changes even on same pathname
- Clears viewer map only when story actually changes
- Allows re-opening viewer dialog when media ID changes

## Benefits

### Immediate Improvements
- âœ… **First story reliability** - Media ID found even without URL ID
- âœ… **Stable cache keys** - Consistent across navigation patterns
- âœ… **Accurate viewer counts** - No more "25 then 6" issues
- âœ… **Share link support** - Works on direct story share URLs
- âœ… **Carousel navigation** - Detects story changes in multi-story posts

### Technical Benefits
- **Fast path optimization** - Checks cheapest sources first
- **Fallback robustness** - 6 different sources ensure ID is found
- **Owner scoping** - Reduces false positives in ID matching
- **Base64 decoding** - Extracts IDs from inline bootstrap data

## Testing the Enhancement

To verify the media ID detection is working:

1. Open DevTools Console on a story page
2. Run this diagnostic:
```javascript
(function(){
  const o = (location.pathname.match(/\/stories\/([^/]+)/)||[])[1];
  return {
    url: location.pathname.match(/\/stories\/[^/]+\/(\d{15,20})/)?.[1] || null,
    seenBy: document.querySelector('a[href*="/seen_by/"]')?.href || null,
    alt: [...document.querySelectorAll('link[rel="alternate"][href*="/stories/"]')].map(l=>l.href).slice(0,3),
    deep: [...document.querySelectorAll('meta[property^="al:"][content*="/stories/"]')].map(m=>m.content),
    owner: o
  };
})()
```

You should see at least one source showing the story ID.

## Installation

1. Download `storylister-v16.1.zip`
2. Extract the ZIP file
3. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
4. Enable "Developer mode" (top right)
5. Remove any previous version
6. Click "Load unpacked" and select the extracted folder
7. Visit Instagram stories to test

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] First story shows correct viewer count (matches "Seen by")
- [ ] Navigate to 2nd/3rd story - counts remain stable
- [ ] Go back to first story - same count as before
- [ ] Refresh on first story - count doesn't drop
- [ ] Share link stories work correctly
- [ ] Multi-story carousel navigation works
- [ ] NEW badges remain consistent

## Summary

v16.1 solves the "first story problem" definitively by implementing comprehensive media ID detection. With 6 different sources checked in priority order, the extension now reliably finds the story ID regardless of URL format, ensuring stable caching and accurate viewer tracking across all navigation patterns.
