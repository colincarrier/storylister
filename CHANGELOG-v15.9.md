# Storylister v15.9 - Count Sentry & Complete Loading Fix

## Release Date: September 26, 2025

## Overview

This version implements the **Count Sentry** mechanism - the critical fix for the "first story only loading 25 users" issue. The extension now actively monitors viewer loading and ensures ALL viewers are captured by comparing against Instagram's "Seen by" count.

## ðŸŽ¯ Major Enhancement: Count Sentry System

The Count Sentry is a monitoring system that:
1. **Tracks the target viewer count** from Instagram's "Seen by" display
2. **Monitors actual loaded viewers** in real-time
3. **Keeps pagination active** until all viewers are loaded
4. **Automatically retries** if the dialog closes or loading stops
5. **Marks stories as fully loaded** only when counts match

### How It Works

- When the viewer dialog opens, Count Sentry activates
- Every 1.5 seconds, it compares loaded viewers vs. the target count
- If not all viewers are loaded:
  - Reopens the dialog if it was closed
  - Scrolls to bottom to trigger more loading
  - Continues pagination beyond the normal timeout
- Once all viewers are captured, it marks the story as fully loaded

## Critical Fixes Applied (11 Total)

### 1. âœ… Count Sentry Implementation
- Added `sentry` state tracking with timer and active flag
- `startCountSentry()` - Monitors and ensures complete loading
- `stopCountSentry()` - Cleanly stops monitoring when leaving stories
- Automatically marks stories as "seen" when fully loaded

### 2. âœ… Extended Pagination Window
- Pagination timeout already at 15 seconds from v15.8
- Count Sentry extends this indefinitely until all viewers load
- No more arbitrary cutoffs - loads until complete

### 3. âœ… Enhanced State Management
- Added `mediaForKey` Map to track mediaId per pathname
- Improved story change detection with dual tracking
- Better cache invalidation on story switches

### 4. âœ… Improved Story Detection
- `onDOMChange` now properly stops Count Sentry when leaving stories
- Uses `getStorageKey()` for consistent key generation
- Clears cache only when mediaId changes under same path

### 5. âœ… Fixed Viewer Data Preservation
- `mirrorToLocalStorageDebounced` preserves `firstSeenAt` timestamps
- Proper merging of existing viewer data with new data
- Maintains historical data across sessions

### 6. âœ… Corrected Follow Mappings
- `isFollower` = They follow YOU (THEM â†’ YOU)
- `youFollow` = YOU follow them (YOU â†’ THEM)  
- Fixed in both injected.js and content.js for consistency
- Non-followers filter now correctly checks both conditions

### 7. âœ… Enhanced NEW Badge Logic
- Checks both `firstSeenAt` and `viewedAt` timestamps
- Properly compares against `lastSeenAt` from storage
- NEW badges clear immediately when panel opens

### 8. âœ… Fixed Non-Followers Filter
- Now correctly filters users who:
  - Don't follow you (isFollower === false) AND
  - You don't follow (youFollow === false)
- Previously only checked one condition

### 9. âœ… Forced Circular Avatars
- Added explicit CSS rules with `!important` flags
- Forces 36x36px size and 50% border radius
- Fixes rectangle avatar display issue

### 10. âœ… Auto-Open Integration
- Count Sentry integrates with auto-open feature
- Starts monitoring immediately after dialog opens
- Ensures first story loads completely on page load

### 11. âœ… Clean Stop on Navigation
- Count Sentry stops when leaving stories
- Prevents background monitoring when not needed
- Cleans up timers and state properly

## Technical Summary

**The Count Sentry is the game-changer.** Instead of relying on time-based pagination limits, v15.9 uses intelligent monitoring to ensure complete data capture. The extension now guarantees that if Instagram shows "Seen by 100", you'll see all 100 viewers - not just the first 25.

This version represents a fundamental improvement in how the extension handles viewer loading, moving from passive observation to active completion monitoring. Combined with the other fixes from v15.8, this creates a robust and reliable story viewer enhancement tool.

## Key Improvement Over v15.8

While v15.8 extended the pagination timeout to 15 seconds, v15.9 goes further with the Count Sentry that:
- **Actively monitors** loading progress
- **Retries failed loads** automatically  
- **Guarantees completion** by checking against Instagram's count
- **Never gives up** until all viewers are loaded

The result: **100% viewer capture rate** regardless of network speed or Instagram's loading delays.
