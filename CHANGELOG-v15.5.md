# Storylister v15.5 - Complete ChatGPT Surgical Patches

## Release Date: September 25, 2025

## Overview

This release applies ChatGPT's complete set of surgical patches that address all 4 root causes of the critical failures identified in v15.4.

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ First Story Missing Initial Data
**Problem**: Extension was loading AFTER Instagram's first API call
**Solution**: Early injection at document start to catch first viewer chunk
- Added immediate script injection at top of content-backend.js
- Ensures fetch hook is in place before first story loads
- Fixes wrong counts on first story

### 2. ✅ Reactions Not Detected  
**Problem**: Checking old API fields that Instagram no longer provides
**Solution**: Updated to read new reaction fields
- Now checks `latest_reaction.reaction_emoji` and `has_liked`
- DOM fallback updated with broader selectors for heart icons
- Unified `normalizeViewer()` function handles all reaction formats

### 3. ✅ Follower/Following Filters Inverted
**Problem**: Misunderstanding of Instagram's API semantics
**Solution**: Corrected follower mapping logic
- `friendship_status.following` = YOU follow THEM (youFollow)
- `friendship_status.followed_by` = THEY follow YOU (isFollower)
- All filters now show correct user sets

### 4. ✅ Stale Cache on Navigation/Refresh
**Problem**: Old data persisting when navigating between stories
**Solution**: MediaId-based cache management
- `canonicalKey()` using mediaId for stable caching
- Multiple fallbacks for mediaId detection (seen-by link, meta tags, data attributes)
- Stale cache cleared when mediaId changes

## Technical Improvements

### Enhanced MediaId Detection Chain
1. Seen-by link href (most reliable)
2. Link alternate tags in DOM
3. data-media-id attributes
4. URL path fallback

### Removed Problematic Features
- ❌ Video pausing code (was causing play/pause loops)
- ❌ Complex account detection (replaced with simple "Seen by" check)

### Code Organization
- Single `normalizeViewer()` function shared between fetch and XHR
- Consistent field naming across all components
- Backward compatibility maintained

## What's Working Now

✅ **First story shows correct count** - All viewers captured from initial load  
✅ **Reactions detected and filterable** - Hearts show up and filters work  
✅ **Follower/Following filters correct** - Shows right user groups  
✅ **Refresh maintains correct counts** - No more data loss on reload  
✅ **Navigation works smoothly** - Back/forward doesn't mix data  
✅ **Avatars and usernames clickable** - Direct links to Instagram profiles
