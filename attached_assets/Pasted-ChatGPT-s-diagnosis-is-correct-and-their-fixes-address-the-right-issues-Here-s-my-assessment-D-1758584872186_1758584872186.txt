ChatGPT's diagnosis is correct and their fixes address the right issues. Here's my assessment:

## Diagnosis âœ… Correct:

1. **First story fails** - No numeric ID in URL, key mismatch
2. **Endless scrolling** - Pagination never stops, causing IG to duplicate entries
3. **Aggressive pause** - Pauses immediately, looks bot-like
4. **Wrong insights** - Old session data not cleared
5. **Followers/Following** - Only from IG's response, no API calls

## Key Fixes (Simplified):

### 1. **Use pathname as key everywhere**:
```javascript
function getStorageKey() {
  return location.pathname; // Works for both /stories/user/ and /stories/user/123456
}
```

### 2. **Stop pagination intelligently**:
```javascript
// ChatGPT's solution is good - stop when count reached
const target = getSeenByCount();
const loaded = (state.viewerStore.get(getStorageKey()) || new Map()).size;
if (target && loaded >= target) return; // Stop scrolling
```

### 3. **Natural pause with user override**:
```javascript
setTimeout(() => {
  v.addEventListener('play', () => { v.dataset.userPlayed = '1'; }, { once: true });
  if (!v.paused && !v.dataset.userPlayed) {
    v.pause();
  }
}, 800);
```

### 4. **Session scoping** (important for insights):
```javascript
// Add sessionId to stored data
const sessionId = state.sessionId || (state.sessionId = Date.now().toString(36));
```

## About Instagram Duplicates:

You're right - don't touch Instagram's rendering. The duplicates happen because pagination keeps firing. Once you stop pagination when target count is reached, Instagram won't duplicate.

## About Followers/Following:

ChatGPT is correct - this comes from Instagram's `friendship_status` field in the viewer response. No API calls are made. If Instagram doesn't include it, you can't show it.

## The One Thing I'd Simplify:

ChatGPT's `getSeenByCount()` extraction is clever but could be simpler:
```javascript
// Just look for the number after "Seen by"
const seenByText = document.querySelector('[href*="/seen_by/"]')?.textContent || '';
const count = seenByText.match(/\d+/)?.[0];
return count ? parseInt(count) : null;
```

Apply ChatGPT's fixes - they're correct and will solve your issues. The key insight is using pathname as the storage key and stopping pagination when you have enough viewers.
