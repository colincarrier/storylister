# Storylister v15.4 - Critical Navigation & Detection Fixes

## Release Date: September 24, 2025

## Overview

This release applies 4 critical improvements from ChatGPT's latest analysis to fix navigation issues and improve story detection.

## Critical Fixes Applied

### 1. MediaId Change Detection üîÑ
**Prevents data mixing during back/forward navigation**
- Detects when a new story loads under the same pathname
- Resets viewer map when mediaId changes for a key
- Fixes incorrect viewer counts when using browser navigation
- Prevents stale data from appearing after back/forward

### 2. DOM-Based Reaction Fallback ‚ù§Ô∏è
**Adds redundancy for reaction detection**
- New `mergeReactsFromDialogIntoMap()` function
- Looks for heart icons in the viewer dialog DOM
- Marks users as reacted when API data is missing
- Provides backup when network response lacks reaction data

### 3. Enhanced Cache Structure üì¶
**Stores mediaId with cached data**
```js
store[key] = { 
  mediaId: currentMediaId,  // NEW: Helps detect story changes
  viewers: Array.from(map.entries()), 
  fetchedAt: Date.now() 
};
```
- Enables story change detection on page reload
- Prevents serving wrong data after navigation

### 4. Simplified Own Story Detection ‚úÖ
**More reliable story ownership check**
- New `isOwnStory()` function with bulletproof logic
- Checks for "Seen by" control (only on YOUR stories)
- No complex account checking needed
- Works immediately on first story

## Technical Details

### Before v15.4 Issues:

- Complex account checking logic sometimes failed

### After v15.4 Fixes:
- Each story's data isolated by mediaId tracking
